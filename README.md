![dapa](https://a.top4top.io/p_3188rnvcf1.png)
This tool allows users to retrieve SEO-related data (such as domain authority, page authority, domain age, and IP address) for a list of domains by interacting with the EclipseSec API. It's built with Python and supports multi-threaded domain processing to improve efficiency when working with larger domain lists.

## Features : 
- **Multi-threaded** : Efficiently process multiple domains in parallel, reducing the time it takes to retrieve data for large domain lists.
- **SEO Metrics** : Retrieve important SEO metrics such as Domain Authority (DA), Page Authority (PA), domain age, and IP address for each domain.
- **API Key Validation** : The tool checks the validity of your API key before processing any domains. If your API key is invalid, it provides a message and redirects you to the registration page for obtaining a valid key.
- **Cross-platform Console Clearing** : Automatically clears the console (for both Windows and Linux) for a cleaner user experience.
